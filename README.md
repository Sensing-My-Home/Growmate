## Context

Growing plants has always been a popular hobby amongst households, but also a difficult one, since there are different types of plants that need specific care. ​


The demand for indoor plants grew 18% during the Covid-19 pandemic and nowadays 7 in 10 millennials call themselves a plant parent. ​


The availability in technology and its further growth in the market led to the development of useful systems for monitoring and helping the owners creating optimal conditions for their plants.​


## Problem

* Each species requires its own specific acclimatization process.​

* Individuals with limited experience may struggle to provide adequate care for certain plants.​

* The daily demands of life can cause individuals to overlook the necessary maintenance required to keep their plants healthy.​

* Finding new species to cultivate can be a challenging and time-consuming task.


## What we will try to achieve with GrowMate 
* Facilitate the acclimatization process of plant species.​

* Provide daily reminders and suggestions to assure that the plants are receiving its proper needed care. ​

* Suggest plant species that follow similar growth patterns and behavior.
