# Mobile App

For development purposes:
- install Node.js
- afterwards, install the expo-cli package globally:

```npm install --global expo-cli```

To run the project, it is possible to do so as:

```
expo start --android
```
```
expo start --ios
```

```
expo start --web
```

The first two require some sort of emulator, whereas the third one 
can be ran in any browser.
